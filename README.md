Title: Quantum Simulator

This project implements a number of low-qubit quantum algorithms, such as Bennett's, Deutch's, Bernstein-Vazirani, Simon's, Shor's, and Grover's.

This project also implements a number of basic quantum gates in order to construct these algorithms, and the ability to measure states.

Currently, the project simply contains the implementations, along with tests to ensure correctness.

In order to test the simulator, simply run each file in the commandline.

Example 1: python3 qAlgorithms.py

Example 2: python3 qGates.py

Example 3: python3 qMeasurement.py
